# Drug Abuse Detection via Facial Analysis
### Using PyTorch, FastAPI, and Flet

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **client–server application** that detects drug abuse through facial image analysis.  
It uses a **PyTorch-trained EfficientNet-B0 model** for classification, **FastAPI** for backend inference,  
and **Flet** for the desktop client interface.
